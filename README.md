# AutoCUPSPass
**AutoCUPSPass** is a Python tool designed for penetration testers to automate the process of changing the root password on systems running CUPS and accessible via SSH. The tool scans a given subnet, attempts to connect to systems using the provided SSH credentials, changes the root password, and then verifies if the password change was successful.
